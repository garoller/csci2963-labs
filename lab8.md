[FreeBSD Bug Report]()

It is important to maintain good documentation for clarity and sustainability. If a project is poorly documented, users or new 

developers may become discouraged if trying to get involved with the project, and if it is harder for new people to learn how to

improve a project, it is less likely that they will actually contribute.
