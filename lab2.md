1. Read the four criteria for Free Software.

2. Why is it important to choose a license?

 It is important to choose a license, because a license determines the development of that project or code. 

 Other programmers should avoid editing nonlicensed code, which takes away the value of open source. Getting a 

 license allows othe smart people to improve existing code, without the threat of litigation. Additionally, choosing 

 the right license is important becasue that affects how the code is distributed and used after changes are made. The 
 
 original developer has the right to choose which kind of license they want, becasue it affects the development.


3. Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

  It is important to not use an unlicensed project, because that project is proprietary to the original developer.

  Changing an unlicensed project and distributing it, violates their ownership, and could lead to legal problems or 

  litigation. 


4. Do you agree with the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher?

 I do agree with the article. The Web beat Gopher because of ease of use and access, and what the author calls 

 "mind share". Gopher does not support hypertexts, and without this feature, the Web becomes much more useful. 

 Also, the Web has a high "mind share"; essentially, a better brand name. It captured more mind share earlier in 

 the development process, and then gained more momentum as improvements were made.


5. Justify why one of the licenses were chosen.

 Linux GPL v2

 The original developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds, was motivated to develop a new operating system, by a sub-par operating 

 system, MINIX, which was only allowed to be used for educational purposes. During the development of Linux, GNU 
 
 applications replaced MINIX components, because it was easier to use the available code, licensed under GPL. Torvalds then 
 
 switched from the original license to GPL to utilize the GNU applications. He was forced to license Linux under GPL in order 
 
 to use the GNU applications, but the GPL also aligns with his original frustration with the limitation of MINIX.


6. Think of an example project. Pick a license using the LICENESE choose by Github.

 Example project - Mailpile
 
 Current license - GNU GPL
 

7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for 

 the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences.


8. Create a repository and choose a license. 
 Repository - 

9. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of 

   the project, and what license will you choose.
